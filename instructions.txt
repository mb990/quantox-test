First create database 'quantox'. Or you can name it however you want, tho you will have to change credentials in config.php.

Then, insert file 'users.sql' into your database. It will now create table 'users' with needed columns for you.

Third, go to 'http://localhost/quantox-test' and it will redirect you to the login/register page, or you can simply
go to 'http://localhost/quantox-test/views/pages/register' directly.

Register an account and login into the system.

And that's it :) now you can search users or see About page, also you can logout on the logout button.
