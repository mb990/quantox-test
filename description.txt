So, first i red and analyzed the sheet, then i created a skeleton folders and files that i knew i was going to use
for this App, although i'v added some more later on, and then i did the initial commit to my GitHub repo.

Config.php, Database.php and User.php are core files here. In those i put the variables and functions needed for the
app to work. I also used .htaccess file two times, for security and a bit nicer url. Views are separated into includes
and real pages, with index.php having as minimum as possible data inside the file, everything comes from other pages
via includes. There is also an .sql file, which the user can import into his database to easy him things.

I found out some nice redirection technique, so i used it if a person tries to approach forbidden pages. Check it out!
